# Workout-Tracker

## Description: The Project

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
 
This is a Workout-Tracker app that lets the user track their workout progress.
 
Application should allow users to add new workouts.
Application should allow users to record workouts.
